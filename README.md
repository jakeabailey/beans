beans is a convolutional neural network with the aim of identifying hollow coffee beans from full beans.

Hollow beans can impact the taste of a cup of coffee, and are time consuming to find and remove.

This is my first neural network outside of the traditional 'hello world' example with the mnist dataset.

As seen in the file 'ai.ipynb', the accuracy isn't great (79%) and, in my testing, fluctuates greatly with consecutive runs.
